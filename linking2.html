       	<td style="background-color:#A04000;padding: 20px;">Ice Cream is made of water, milk, cream, sugar, and at least 10% milk fat. These ingredients are rapidly churned together, causing it to have an air content of 30-50%, which creates its light and creamy texture. Compared to gelato and yogurt, it uses cream as its main dairy ingredient, and contains more fat, cream, and air.</td>
       	<td style="background-color:#AF601A;padding: 20px;">Gelato is made up of water, milk, cream, sugar, and between 5-9% milk fat.  The ingredients are churned together more slowly, causing it to have less air content than ice cream, which also makes it denser, heavier, milkier, and more flavorful than ice cream. Its main dairy ingredient is milk, and contains less cream and fat than ice cream.</td>
       	<td style="background-color:#B9770E;padding: 20px;">Yogurt is made up of water, milk solids, cultured dairy, sugar, and between 3-6% milk fat. Since it contains cultured dairy, it contains bacteria as well, like Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophiles. Compared to ice cream and gelato, it contains less fat, but often contains more sugar to compensate for the tart flavor from the cultured milk. In addition, its main dairy ingredient is cultured milk.</td>
